# Querying-on-UN-Education-Data

This was a project undertaken by Lilit Mesropyan and Utkarsh Agarwal to explore UN Education Data.

The data is contained in the Raw Data folder. It was processed using Pandas DataFrames and then imported into PostgreSQL using import_data.sql(the schema can be found in schema.ddl). The processed files are available in the Processed Data folder and the demo folder contains samples of querying on the database.

The results can be found in the Results folder.
